# Message Modes Cookbook

Understanding the different modes and flags available for sending messages is crucial to ensure that your smart contracts behave as intended.
While [message modes](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes) section provided detailed descriptions of these modes and flags, in this section we will illustrate their practical application through specific examples.

:::info IMPORTANT
You can check [this example](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/42ed45726e4fe994b7fd6dbf953a2ac24ecd77753858abeda9d6755c664a537a) as a real-world validation.

#### Message value and account balance

Please check how [get_balance](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#get_balance) works to better understand `balance` inside TVM.

All TON tokens owned by a contract are reflected in the [contract balance](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/block.tlb#L263C1-L265C20). Some of these tokens are also attributed to the currently processed incoming [message](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb#commonmsginfo) - a mechanism that works effectively because any TON transaction involving a [non-system contract](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/governance) processes exactly one incoming message at a time. 

Therefore, any blockchain payment may come either:

- From the incoming message `value`.
  For instance, computation fees are paid in this way, unless contract calls [accept_message](v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/accept-message-effects). This ensures that malicious actors cannot spend contract's balance on handling their data.
- From the contract `balance` (will not touch amount of TON designated as incoming this transaction).
  Storage fees in workchains 0 and -1, as well as most actions, are currently examples of this.

#### Fees

Actual transaction fees will vary depending on the blockchain configuration, the smart contract code and other factors. When a message is received, part of the contract `balance` will be consumed by [storage fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#storage-fee) and gas_fees if the message `value` [is above certain amount](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#compute-phase-skipped).

According to the [transaction flow](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases) there are 5 phases:

- Storage, consisting of [account storage](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L651-L675) and [in_msg import](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L783-L816)
- [Credit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L959-L981), where in_msg `value` is added to the `balance`
- Compute, where the actual smart contract code is executed in TVM
- Action, where actions like `SENDRAWMSG` are performed
- Bounce, where everything about bouncing is handled

The order is: storage_fee -> import_fee -> gas_fee -> action_fee + fwd_fee

:::info IMPORTANT
The table is populated based on [this example](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b5e14a9c4a4e982fda42d6079c3f84fa48e76497a8f3fca872f9a3737f1f6262). You can check the [**live calculator**](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula).

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B**, [msg_fwd_fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#forward-fees) are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` are deducted from `value`.

In case of an error during [action phase](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes), the message will be skipped instead of throwing an [exit code](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes#standard-exit-codes).

If no errors occur the result is the same as [`mode = 0`](#1-mode-0-no-flags-basic-message).

The key difference is that `flag 16` specifically creates bounces for [action phase errors](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes#standard-exit-codes), while the message's [built-in bounce flag](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/wallet#internal-message-creation) handles protocol-level failures like:
  - The destination contract does not exist.
  - The destination contract throws an unhandled exception.
